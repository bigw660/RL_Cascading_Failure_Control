title: Midterm Practice Problems
permalink: /c/review.html
---

These problems will help you study for the midterm. You should not expect the exam to be exactly like this.

## 1. Arrays, Pointers, and Strings
**1.1:** What are `*p, *t, j,` and `k` after this code is run?

```c
int j, k;
int *p = &j;
int *t;
*p = 200;
k = *p + 500;
t = &k;
*p = *t;
k = 10;
```
> Hint: You may find it easiest to write out a  memory diagram for questions like this. Always think through the code carefully and you should have a precise understanding of what happens if a `*` or `&` are used.

**1.2:** What will this program print?

```c
char alphabet[9] = "abcdefgh";
char *str = alphabet;
str[0] = 'P';
str[5] = 'Q';
str += 2;
*str = 'R';
str[3] = 'S';

printf("alph: %s\n", alphabet);
printf("str : %s\n", str);
```
> Hint: Remember that a pointer does not make a copy of whatever it points to!


**1.3:** What entries in the days array does this fill in and to what values?

```c
int days[365];
int *dayptr = days;
*dayptr = 76;
dayptr++;
*dayptr = 79;
dayptr[10] = 80;
```
> Hint: We saw pointer arithmetic in [Module C-1](1/#pointermath), but you may be confused about what is happening to a pointer's address when you see a line like `dayptr++`.  We would expect this to increase the address of `dayptr` by one, but in reality that would be problematic since each integer in the array consumes several bytes (typically 4), so adding 1 to the address would make it point to the middle of the integer. Therefore, the C compiler automatically translates `dayptr++` into an instruction that increases the address by 4, not 1.  Similarly, the line `dayptr = dayptr + 10` would actually increase the address stored in `dayptr` by `40`. *Thus any math operations performed on a pointer are automatically scaled by the size of the pointer's data type (in this case `int`).*

**1.4:** Write a program that uses a dynamically sized 2D array. The first row should hold the number 1, the second should hold two integers each set to 2, and so on:

```
1
22
333
4444
....
nnnnnn
```
Your array should only use the precise amount of space needed to store the `n` rows of integers. After you have allocated space and filled in all entries in the 2D array you should print it out in the format above.

Write your code in [this Repl.it editor](https://repl.it/@twood02/C-review-2dn). Adjusting `n` should result in a different sized output.

> Hint: Remember, a dynamic array must be allocated from the heap, and in this case we need a different amount of space for each row (1 integer for the first row, 2 integers for the second, etc). Your overall array should be represented by a `int**` variable, and you will need to allocate space for the first dimension of the array (the rows), and then have a for loop to allocate space for the columns in each row.

## 2. Memory
**2.1:** Fill in a memory diagram for when the following code is run until it reaches the HERE comment. Assume that both an int and an int* consume 4 bytes and that malloc() allocates memory in consecutive chunks out of the heap.

```c
void firstFunc() {
  int x = 20;
  int b = 30;
  int * p = malloc(sizeof(int) * 2);
  p[0] = 5;
  p[1] = 6;       
}
void secondFunc() {
  int* c;
  c = (int* ) malloc(sizeof(int));
  int * d;
  d = (int* ) malloc(sizeof(int));
  * c = 45;
  free(d);
  thirdFunc();
  free(c);
}
void thirdFunc() {
  int e = 50;
  int * q;
  q = (int* ) malloc(sizeof(int));
  e = 55;
  *q = 100;
  /**** HERE ****/
  free(q);
  return;
}
void fourthFunc() {
  int z = 23;
  int p = 45;
}       
int main() {
  int x = 10;
  int * y = &x;
  firstFunc();
  secondFunc();
  fourthFunc();
  return 0;
}
```
> Hint: You will need to know the details of [our stack](2/#stackmodel) and [heap](1/#heap) models for the exam. Remember that each call to a function will push a new set of variables onto the stack; when it returns that space will be reclaimed and then reused for whatever function is called next.

**2.2:** How much memory does the following code reserve, and how many 4-byte ints could it store? How could you change the code to always create exactly enough space for 20 integers, even if you werenâ€™t sure if the code would be run on a 16, 32, or 64bit platform?
```c
int* intlist = (int*) malloc(10);
```

> You don't need to memorize the size of every data type, but you should understand why some are larger than others.

**2.3:** Consider [the code in this Repl.it editor](https://repl.it/@twood02/c-review-malloc):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
  int** a;
  a = malloc(10*sizeof(int * ));
  for(int j=0; j < 10; j++) {
    a[j] = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
    for(int k=0; k < 5; k++) {
      a[j][k] = j * k;
      printf("a[%d][%d] = %d\n", j, k, a[j][k]);
    }
  }
  free(a);
  return 0;
}
```
Exactly how much memory does this program allocate on the heap? Does the program correctly free all of the memory it allocates?

> Always look for a `free` that matches every `malloc`

**2.4** The size of a `char` is 1 byte. Use a Repl.it editor to find out the size of a `char*`. Why are they different?

> You don't need to memorize the size of every data type, but you should understand why some are larger than others.

## 3. Data Structures

**3.1:** Consider the code below from [this Repl.it editor](https://repl.it/@twood02/c-review-structs).
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct car {
  char* make;
  char* model;
  int year;
};

struct house {
  char* street;
  int number;
  int sqft;
};

struct person {
  struct car * cars;
  int numCars;
  struct house house;
  char* name;
};

void printCar(struct car* car) {
  printf("Car: %s %s from %d\n", car->make, car->model, car->year);
}

void printHouse(struct house* house) {
  printf("House: %d %s with %d square feet\n", house->number, house->street, house->sqft);
}

void printPerson(struct person* person) {
  // print all cars and house info
}

int main(void) {
  struct person me;
  // fill in data structure

  printPerson(&me);
  return 0;
}
```
The program above includes struct definitions for an accounting program. For each person, it can track multiple cars that they own and a single house.  The struct definitions and print functions for a car and house have been provided. You must enhance the `main()` function so that it fills in information for a person, including a house and two cars. Then you must complete the `printPerson()` function so that it displays an output similar to:

```
Prof. X owns:
Car: Honda Fit from 2014
Car: Ford Fiesta from 2017
House: 315 West St with 2459 square feet
```
*You should not edit the struct definitions or the car/house print functions.*

> Hint: First be sure you understand the structs that have been provided. The `char*` variables are all strings, so you can assign them to constants like "Honda" after creating the relevant struct. Note that a `person` struct needs to be able to store multiple cars, but we don't know in advance how many, so it uses a `struct car* cars` pointer which can be used to create a dynamically sized array.

<!-- ## 4. C and Java
**4.1:** Consider this code which is valid in both C and Java:

```c
int j;
int sum
int stats[10];
// partially fill array
stats[0] = 10;
stats[1] = 10;
stats[2] = 10;
for(j=0; j <10; j++)
{
    sum += stats[j];
}
```
If we were to then print out the value of `sum`, would Java and C give us the same result? Why or why not? -->
